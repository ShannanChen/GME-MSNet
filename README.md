GME-MSNet: Generative models enhanced multi-modality segmentation network of ischemic stroke

This study proposes a multi-modality segmentation network (named MSNet) to segment ischemic stroke lesions from DWI, ADC and FLAIR images. 
On the other hand, to address the lack of FLAIR images, a ResVit-based image generation network is proposed and trained to synthesize FLAIR images. MSNet and the generative network are integrated to realize Generative Models Enhanced Multi-modality Segmentation Network (GME-MSNet).


## Dataset 
We conducted empirical experiments on ISLES'22 publicly accessible datasets, to evaluate the proposed network and modules' performance and utility.


## Code
The paper is being submitted and the full code will be published soon.
